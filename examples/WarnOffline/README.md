# WarnOffline
A PocketMine plugin depending on StatusList (and therefore on SignServerStats) which displays a warning when a Server from the StatusList has gone offline.

## Info:

Anyone with the permission `WarnOffline.notify ` will recieve a message each time a server goes down or recovers which will look like this:
```
[WarnOffline] Server ip:port went OFFLINE
[WarnOffline] Server ip:port went back ONLINE
```
The console will also be notified.

The plugin will recognize that sign and fill it with colorful stats!

### API:
